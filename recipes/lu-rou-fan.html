    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lu Rou Fan is one of the most popular Taiwanese comfort foods. It is similar to the Shanghainese dish <em>hong shao rou</em>. This dish uses small pieces of pieces of pork belly almost making it like a braised meat sauce. Its flavor mainly comes from the famous five spices used commonly in Chinese cooking.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 lb skin-on pork belly</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons oil</li>
        <li>0.9 oz. rock sugar <em>(25g, or about 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar)</em></li>
        <li>1 small onion or a couple of shallots <em>(diced)</em></li>
        <li>8 shiitake mushrooms <em>(diced into 1/2‚Äù pieces)</em></li>
        <li>1/4 cup shaoxing wine <em>(60 ml)</em></li>
        <li>3 tablespoons light soy sauce <em>(45 ml)</em></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dark soy sauce <em>(30 ml)</em></li>
        <li>2 cups water <em>(475 ml)</em></li>
        <li>4 hardboiled eggs <em>(peeled, optional)</em></li>
        <h3>For the spices (wrap everything in cheese cloth and tie with kitchen string):</h3>
    
        <li>3 star anise</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>6 cloves</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns</li>
        <li>2 pieces dried tangerine peel</li>
        <li>2 slices fresh ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil (just enough so that the pork will be fully submerged), and blanch the chopped pork belly for 1 minute. Drain, rinse clean of any scum, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a wok over low heat, and add the sugar. Cook the sugar until it starts to melt and then add the onions. Turn up the heat to medium high and stir-fry the onions for a minute. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry for another couple minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the blanched pork, shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce and water. Stir and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, add the spices (which should be tied in cheese cloth), along with the peeled hardboiled eggs and turn the heat to the lowest setting. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>At this point the meat should be fall-apart tender. To finish the dish, remove the spice packet and turn up the heat to medium high to thicken the sauce, stirring occasionally. This process should take about 5-minutes. The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon, but there should still be plenty of it left. Serve over steamed white rice.</li>
    </ol>
